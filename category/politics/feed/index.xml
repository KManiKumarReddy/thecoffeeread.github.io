Saying that these remarks give the media unnecessary masala to damage the party&#8217;s image, he posted a video on the Narendra Modi app, and said &#8220;It may sound bitter, but it is important for me to say this to you. Sometimes our workers criticise media, but we have to think if we committed mistakes and gave masala to the media.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Narendra Modi Interacting With Lawmakers:</h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3lvjALion8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Of late, several BJP politicians have been shooting of ridiculous statements and with crucial state elections around the corner, it has become a matter of embarrassment for the ruling party. Here&#8217;s a look of who said what in the recent times.</p>
<h2>Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb:</h2>
<p>The Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb was at the receiving end of a lot of potshots when he said India had internet during the Mahabharata times. “This is the country where the episodes of the Mahabharat war were narrated to Dhritarashtra by Sanjay,” he reportedly said at an event in Agartala. “This means technology was there, Internet was there, satellite was there&#8230;”</p>
<h2>Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan:</h2>
<p>Speaking on account of Stephen Hawking&#8217;s death, the Union Science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan controversially claimed that British scientist, who died last month, had said the Vedas might have a theory superior to Albert Einstein’s equation, E=mc2.</p>
<h2>Union Education Minister Satyapal Singh:</h2>
<p>The Union Education Minister Satyapal Singh had shot one of the most ridiculous statements in January when he said that Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution of man was “scientifically wrong” and it needs to be changed in school and college curriculum. He was quoted saying “Darwin’s theory (of evolution of humans) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on Earth he has always been a man.”</p>
<h2>Union Minister Santosh Gangwar:</h2>
<p>In response to the outrage over the Kathua rape case, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar said in a country as big as India people should not make an issue out of one or two rape incidents.</p>

It is the taxpayer’s money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre but they are diverting the money to the development of the North.” Calling the Centre &#8216;cheats&#8217; who refused to give special status to Andhra, the Chief Minister has slammed the BJP led Centre for following a political agenda in changing the population specification for the allocation of central funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all started with the 15th Finance Commission’s (FC) Terms of Reference (ToR), a directive of which advocates the following of 2011 Census instead of 1971 census in regards to the allocation of funds to various states. In the four decades between 1971 and 2011, South Indian states have greatly controlled the population growth while the numbers seem no different in North India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering how effectively the South Indian states implemented population control methodologies, the center’s decision to follow 2011 census amounts to the central government punishing the southern states for controlling the population. Lashing out at the center, Mr. Naidu also asked if the center will also follow the 2011 census for the number of seats each state will have in the parliament. It can be noted that the cash starved Andhra Pradesh has gotten a raw deal from the center in the past too, not to mention the fact that the special status that was promised to the state has been long pending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urging the Southern states to come together against the 15th FC’s ToR, Mr. Naidu hit out at center’s North India and Hindi belt centric approach and slammed the BJP led government for following the approach. In sync with him, is the Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah who tweeted on Friday asking all Southern Chief Ministers to resist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telangana CM, K Chandrasekhar Rao also spoke along these lines, giving out statistics saying, “The Centre earned Rs 50,013 crore in taxes from us the last fiscal ending 2017. It gave back only Rs 24,561 under all their schemes. Amit Shah should know that it is Telangana which gave Rs 25,452 to the Centre.”</span></p>

<p>In March, thousands of farmers walked more than 180 kilometers from various parts of Maharashtra to Mumbai, demanding the loan waiver that was earlier promised by the government.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-bottom:20px;"><img width="960" height="538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-16-at-4.23.37-PM.png" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Maharashtra Farmer&#039;s March" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-16-at-4.23.37-PM.png 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-16-at-4.23.37-PM-300x168.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-16-at-4.23.37-PM-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></div><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They marched regardless of the heat, regardless of the calluses on their feet and regardless of their blood staining the earth. They marched for their life, for their right to live. The 35000 farmers marched over 180KM from across Maharashtra, to Mumbai, in demand of the loan waiver that was originally announced by the Maharashtra government earlier this year. According to the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana, the government of Maharashtra announced a loan waiver of almost Rs. 35,000 crores to the farmers of the state, of which only Rs 12,000 crore has been transferred to the farmers. This is one of the biggest farmer protests that the country saw in the last couple of years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Incidentally, Maharashtra accounts for the highest number of farmer suicides every year, with 4291 suicides recorded in 2015. In fact, India recorded almost 3,00,000 farmer suicides in 1995-2015. To put things in perspective, as Anshul Sinha (a film maker who made a film titled Mitti on the agrarian crisis) says, “A farmer commits suicide every half hour in this country.” These statistics in a country where 49% of the workforce is employed in agriculture is something to be highly concerned about. Another alarming fact that this 49% of the workforce contributes only to 17% of the GDP of the country. But surprisingly enough, India ranks second in the world in terms of farm output. So why does this sector see so many suicides and why is there such a massive agrarian crisis in India?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The answer to this question, according to Anshul, is because of three factors &#8211; economic, environmental and social. “While the social and environmental factors can be overcome to an extent by the farmers themselves, by opting certain methodologies and techniques in farming, the government needs to take a lot of steps to solve the economic factors. Out of the 24 main crops that India produces, the prices of only two crops are decided by the government. Farmers are on the mercy of merchants who decide the prices,” says Anshul, and according to various reports, a standardised support price (a government guaranteed price) is one of the demands of the protesting farmers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the government seems to be taking several steps to solve the agrarian crisis, the situation only seems to be worsening. In fact, the 2018 Union Budget was nicknamed ‘Farmer’s Budget’ by the media as it aimed to provide a lot of benefits to the farmers but it is too early to comment on the efficacy of it. As per currently available records, the rate of growth of the gross value of agricultural produce is -5% in 2015 and -2.5% in 2016. Statistically it is termed as rate of growth but its negative value shows an alarming decline. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming to Maharashtra, the protesting farmers, supported by All India Kisan Sabha, are now demanding an unconditional waiver of loan and electricity bills in addition to a pension scheme. Reportedly, the loan waiver scheme of the state government was implemented in a very shoddy way with even software glitches hindering the process.</span></p>
