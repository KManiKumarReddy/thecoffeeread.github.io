				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charminar has become a global icon of Hyderabad, it is listed among the most recognized structures of India. It is famous for its sorrounding markets and is one of the tourist attractions in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Here are some facts you should about charminar:</p>
<h2>1. HOW OLD DO YOU THINK CHARMINAR IS?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-99" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Charminar was constructed in the year 1591, which makes it 428 years old. It&#8217;s still in good shape, considering the age.</p>
<h2>2. SECRET TUNNELS AND MYSTERY STORIES</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-101" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnnnn-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnnnn-300x201.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnnnn-768x514.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnnnn-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>According to the tales of old, there exists a secret tunnel inside the Charminar, leading all the way to the Golconda fort. There have also been rumors of treasures being hidden there. But till date, no one has been able to find the route out, some say that the tunnel way is haunted and no one has made it till date. The story is till shrouded in mystery.</p>
<h2>3. A CAT&#8217;S HEAD IN THE CHARMINAR</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-102" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cat-Head-Charminar-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cat-Head-Charminar-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cat-Head-Charminar-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cat-Head-Charminar.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>On the eastern side, a cat&#8217;s head is designed in the crest of one of the small arches. Why? Because cats keep away rats, and rats almost destroyed Hyderabad once.</p>
<h2>4. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHARMINAR</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-103" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1-300x188.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1-768x480.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charminar-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It has a lot of religious significance. Charminar is built by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah to celebrate the end of a deadly plague. And it is also believed that Charminar was built to respect the promise Quli Qutub Shah made to Allah.</p>
